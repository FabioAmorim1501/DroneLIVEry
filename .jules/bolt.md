## 2024-05-27 - O(N) Location Lookup Optimization in Nearest Neighbor Algorithm
**Learning:** In routing algorithms like Nearest Neighbor, resolving entity relations using sequential search (O(N)) inside a tight loop creates an O(N*M) bottleneck, particularly evident when string conversion is involved on every iteration.
**Action:** Always pre-compute relational lookups into an O(1) Hash Map/Dictionary before entering complex nesting or graph-traversal algorithms.
